      Hack Week HOWTO
      %br
      %small How to do Hack Week? A guide for starters.
    %h2 Do what you want, but do it.
    %p
      Hack Week is the opportunity for all SUSE engineers to work on projects of
      their passion. You choose, if you contribute to an existing open source project,
      work on openSUSE, or try something new, nobody has tried before. Innovate,
      collaborate, and learn.
    %p
      Enter your ideas as 
      = link_to projects_path
      and update the information there, while working on the project. So others can
      follow, and maybe join. Browse the Wiki for ideas and inspiration. Find
      like-minded developers and team up to multiply your hacking power.
    %p
      Please also add ideas, if you don't know or plan to work on it, when you
      think it would be great, if somebody else would pick it up.
    %h2 Collaborate
    %p
      We encourage you to team up with like-minded developers to work on projects
      jointly. Take the opportunity to work with people from other teams or from the
      community. Get together at an office, make use of all the nice things the
      Internet provides us to collaborate remotely. Don't hesitate to ask others, and
      be open when being asked. If you need any support to enable and improve
      collaboration feel free to contact the Hack Week coordination team.
    %h2 Spread the word
    %p
      We are an open company, and work transparently on open source code. Share
      your code on the platform of your choice, and reference it from the project
      Wiki.
    %p
      Let your colleagues, the community, and the rest of world know about what
      you are doing. Blog, tweet, publish videos, shout to your neighbour on the
      other side of the street. So people can pick up your project, use it, give
      feedback, contribute, or join.
    %h2 Be open-minded, supportive, and respectful
    %p
      Hack Week is a happy and constructive place. Support ideas you like, ignore
      ideas you don't like. Help to improve ideas of others, and accept help to
      improve your own. We encourage discourse and open discussion, but make sure that
      you approach it with and open mind, respect, and the desire to support. And
      don't forget to have a lot of fun ...
