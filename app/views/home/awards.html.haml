        We will have prizes for the winners of the awards. Two winners will get a

        Finally, the most promising projects will get additional hacking time to
        continue on their projects, and make them ready for prime time as part of a
        SUSE or openSUSE product.
      %p
        To be eligible for the awards please make sure that your project is listed on
        the Hack Week Wiki, and it contains all the information and pointers to code
        and other material, the jury will need to judge it.
