        Hack Week is the opportunity for all SUSE engineers to work on projects of
        their passion. You choose, if you contribute to an existing open source project,
        work on openSUSE, or try something new, nobody has tried before. Innovate,
        collaborate, and learn.
      %p
        Enter your ideas in the
        = succeed "," do
          %a{:href => "index.html#projects"} project Wiki
        and
        update the information there, while working on the project. So others can
        follow, and maybe join. Browse the Wiki for ideas and inspiration. Find
        like-minded developers and team up to multiply your hacking power.
      %p
        Please also add ideas, if you don't know or plan to work on it, when you
        think it would be great, if somebody else would pick it up.
      %h2 Collaborate
      %p
        We encourage you to team up with like-minded developers to work on projects
        jointly. Take the opportunity to work with people from other teams or from the
        community. Get together at an office, make use of all the nice things the
        Internet provides us to collaborate remotely. Don't hesitate to ask others, and
        be open when being asked. If you need any support to enable and improve
        collaboration feel free to contact the Hack Week coordination team.
      %h2 Spread the word
      %p
        We are an open company, and work transparently on open source code. Share
        your code on the platform of your choice, and reference it from the project
        Wiki.
      %p
        Let your colleagues, the community, and the rest of world know about what
        you are doing. Blog, tweet, publish videos, shout to your neighbour on the
        other side of the street. So people can pick up your project, use it, give
        feedback, contribute, or join.
      %h2 Be open-minded, supportive, and respectful
      %p
        Hack Week is a happy and constructive place. Support ideas you like, ignore
        ideas you don't like. Help to improve ideas of others, and accept help to
        improve your own. We encourage discourse and open discussion, but make sure that
        you approach it with and open mind, respect, and the desire to support. And
        don't forget to have a lot of fun ...
