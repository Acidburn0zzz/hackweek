        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>When you have a company directory with more then 1000 users using it, it is almost meaningless when you looking at the name, email and phone number. You don't know what that person do and working on. 
        What we need is "secondlife" like 3D emulation of our work space. Create your own image and symbol online and let your script answer all the possible for you. You then can create a self-explain or resume like description on your symbol. So when someone is looking for you in the direction, eGuide will fly you from ourside of the earth then dive into the world map, country, city, building, floor, section, sit then your symbol. When others click on your symbol, self-description will be provided, voice greeting, and other job description like text will be avalible. Of course a person FAQ will be like for CEO type char, message board and blog linker will also be addon etc </p>
