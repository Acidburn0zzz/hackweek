          Get Enlightenment 17 into openSUSE

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <richtext>
              <p>Enlightenment 17 is good looking, but resource friendly, very well usable desktop environment. Unfortunately it's not present in openSUSE distribution and current state of X11:Enlightenment is awful. As a result, there were several home projects with these packages and no effort to fix current state.</p>
              <p>Project X11:Enlightenment:Nightly is following SVN revisions closely and is already providing well working packages for a while. To improve this repository we need to add more packages</p>
              <p>We also have X11:Enlightenment:Factory which contains released versions of EFL and E17 and packages are slowly accepted from this project to openSUSE:Factory.</p>
              <p>
                More things to do:
                <ul>
                  <li>It would be great to integrate E17 to openSUSE installer so it would be an option for desktop environment choice.</li>
                  <li>create another project containing not released (but useful software) built against released EFL and E17 versions</li>
                  <li>test and report bugs</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

                <p>I vote for this but please don't remove e16 which comes in enlightenment package currently.
        When adding e17 we could think about renaming the current enlightenment package and clean up the descriptions to make clear whether e16 or e17 is inside.</p>

                <p>I don't plan to remove e16 as it is stable project and has its own users. Renaming enlightenment package to e16 would be useful for naming consistency.</p>

                <p>Maybe throw away enlightenment package completely and call it
        e16, e17 or enlightenment-e16, enlightenment-e17. So users would not automatically "upgrade" e16 to e17 by mistake.</p>

                <p>Packaging, creating pattern, searching for alternative package names in other distributions, security audit of tools accessing CPU speed and bluetooth power, it would be nice to create good wallpaper following E17 design.
        
        If there will be chance, also integration into installer as one of desktop environment choices.</p>
                <p>And for really bored people add EFL support into libyui :)</p>
