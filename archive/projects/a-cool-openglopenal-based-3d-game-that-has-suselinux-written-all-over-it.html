<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A 3D Racing game, with lot of in-game advertisement for SUSE and Linux. 
This will help spreading the brand - SUSE, and get Linux out of "not for gamers/only for geeks" myth.
In fact gamers and geeks are synonymous most of the time ;-)</p>
<p>The artwork(models, textures, sound, music) could be revamped to make it polished once the game is finished. As of now the core game itself is incomplete and requires lot of improvements, in the areas of physics, support for models created with blender, support for network playability, AI cars etc.. as of now there is no proper gameplay.. expected?</p>
<p>Though making a 3D game with all the bells and whistles will be a daunting task(enjoyable though), if we are happy with the idea of promoting suse and Linux, we could create a lot of mini games.</p>
