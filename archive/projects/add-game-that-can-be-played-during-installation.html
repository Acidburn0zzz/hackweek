        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Back in the Caldera days, the user got the option to play tetris while installation was in progress. I always liked this feature and think it's much more fun than watching the slide show or the details view.</p>
        <p>We could use a different game for each version of openSUSE.</p>
        <p>I talked to YaST people about this and I was told that technically it's not hard to do (I guess every QT based (or even KDE?) game will work) but it was never accepted. For openSUSE I think this would be great ... for SLE* it's probably not a good idea ;-) </p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Daniel Bornkessel originated this idea.</p>
        <p>Ladislav Michnovic & Lukas Ocilka are going to work on this together (PlayGameDuringInstallation Add-On Product)</p>
