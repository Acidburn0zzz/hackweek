        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The thing that has always annoyed me about computers is that we have this great piece of computing power, but a lack of ways to interface to the real world.  Why couldnt we have an IEEE standard Data Acquisition port on every motherboard? Surely these could be mass produced and made cheaply?  Ahh anyway...</p>
        <p>In the mean time we can make use of this cool new desktop, and make widgets for analog, digital meters, switches and pilot lights.  </p>
        <p>The configuration for a meter/light widget could have two modes.  </p>
        <p>One via check box, say the RS232 port is checked, and which lines of those ports are being used as an input or output.  </p>
        <p>The second is an expert mode, where the configurationg could use simple scripts to help interface to RS232, parallel and USB ports or even perform software commands.</p>
        <p>Doing this you could have a simple native control system that can use different plasma activities per item controlled.</p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Fairs originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
