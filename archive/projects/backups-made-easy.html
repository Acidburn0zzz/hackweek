        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There is a very nice open source backup solution called Dirvish.   As any other backup tool, it does a complete backup of the data, but incremental backups are created by hard linking all the files from a previous date, removing differences and adding new files to the tree.</p>
        <p>Doing daily backups is very cheap: only the differences consume space, but if you browse the file system, you will actually see various 'views' depending on the directory that you access: if you access the backup under 2007-01-01 you see the tree as it was done that day, if you go to 2007-01-02 you see the tree as it was the next day, but the file system only consumes the difference.</p>
        <p>Dirvish is currently a set of perl scripts that drive rsync.   All the hard work is done by rsync, and dirvish takes care of the policy: how often to backup, when to remove extra backups, which ones to keep and so on.</p>
        <p>The configuration is fairly complicated, writing a small UI on top of the Dirvish functionality should be easy.</p>
        <p>And since this works on top of rsync, dirvish can backup to remote servers, or it can backup other machines into a backup device</p>
