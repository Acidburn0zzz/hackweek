        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>To date, activities to improve on the current desktop-metaphor (especially its usability) can roughly be categorized as follows:</p>
        <p>  * Menus, however improved upon the original hierarchical approach (Kickoff in KDE, new GNOME-main-menu)
          * Docks (Macintosh, Avant, KDocker etc.)
          * Sidebars (Google Desktop, BigBoard from Red Hat's 'Online Desktop', Vista Sideobard or whatever it's called)</p>
        <p>These attempts can be categorized by how much screen-estate they constantly take, versus how easily they are constantly accessible:</p>
        <p>Sidebars---------->Menus  ----------->Docks</p>
        <p>wasteful ---------------------------->compact</p>
        <p>cluttered --------------------------->simple to use</p>
        <p>always accessible------------------>not always accessible</p>
        <p>While Menus represent a good middle ground, not much innovation happens there - naturally. Most OSes try to combine the best of both worlds by having a couple of 'favorite' applications easily accessible (quick-launch icons, Dock, gnome-main-menu favorites) and hiding the rest of them somewhere else (deep hierarchy-level, application-browser, applications-folder). Even seemingly very different concepts go in similar directions there; like having an 'application browser' in both openSUSE and Red Hat's coming 'online desktop'. As Linus Torvalds said "It turns out that "round" is simply a good form for a wheel to have".</p>
        <p>The only real innovation that I have seen lately that figures similarly favorably on the axis above as the 'menu'-approach is the launcher that comes with ASUSTek's version of Xandros Linux for the 'Eee-PC'. Please see a demonstration that someone (not me) has put up here: http://honeypothack.com/eee/internet.htm</p>
        <p>If this menu was enlarged for a high-resolution desktop, it could replace the current desktop analogy which has become pretty void of function - it usually contains only a few icons linking to HD-partitions and the Trash-folder.</p>
        <p>If the ASUSTek's menu's tabs for application categories were constantly visible at the top of the screen we would sacrifice a little screen-estate - as little screen estate as the standard GNOME desktop sacrifices anyway, but we would get some real boost in accessibility IMHO.</p>
        <p>ASUS have  published the source-code ([[http://dlsvr01.asus.com/pub/ASUS/EeePC/701/EeePC701_071012.zip]]), though only as part of a giant archive containing the whole Eee-PC OS.</p>
        <p>As a compromise, the existing gnome-main-menu could be modified:
