        <h1>Chroot-jail management tool</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>On Linux, chroot jails can be used as a practical tool for securing applications and creating environments that are sealed off from the rest of the system without the overhead of a complete virtualized system.</p>
        <p>Currently, there are several tools & applications which ease the creation of such jails but none of them provides a proper way for updating and checking the consistency of existing jails.</p>
        <p>The idea is to create a tool that allows the automatic creation of minimal jails, containing only the necessary files for each application which are copied over from the host system. Various component types can be defined and then used in multiple chroot configurations which can be updated automatically as soon as the host system receives an update.</p>
        <p>Possible use cases:
          * Web applications
          * Sealed-off SSH and SFTP access
          * Untrusted closed source binaries</p>
        <h5>OpenSSH / SFTP</h5>
        <p>A [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/chrootssh/|well-tested]] patch for OpenSSH exists which allows the chrooting of individual users directly after they log in. This is very useful if you want to setup secure file transfer and restrict the user to a certain directory instead of allowing him to browse through the whole system directory tree.
        You can use this method together with sftp-server or rsync -e ssh.</p>
        <h5>Web applications</h5>
        <p>Some web applications are error prune and subject to frequent security
        updates. In an uncontrolled environment, for example on a server with many users which are allowed to run dynamic web sites, it's essential that old,
        outdated web apps don't compromise the security of the rest of the system.
        A possible solution would be to create individual jails for each website with
        interpreters like PHP, Perl or Python. A web server can communicate with the interpreters using TCP/IP or UNIX domain sockets via the
        [[http://www.fastcgi.com/|FastCGI protocol]].</p>
        <h5>Closed source binaries</h5>
        <p>Untrusted binaries are another possible subject for jailing. For example
        one could want to run a game server like Unreal Tournament which has been and
        is subject to remote security issues.</p>
        <h5>Further security</h5>
        <p>There are several pseudo-shells that chroot and afterwards drop the privileges to a certain user. For this project, http://www.jmcresearch.com/projects/jail/ would be practical.</p>
        <p>Additional security for chroot jails is provided by the
        [[http://www.grsecurity.net/|grsecurity kernel patchset]] which closes some
        holes that could be used to break out of jails.</p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Wolfgang Frisch originated this idea. There's already some written Python code, so it's sort of work-in-progress though I'd like to do a rewrite and of course would be happy about any help from anyone who's interested in this topic :)</p>
