        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The openSUSE Build Service already supports building packages for a variety of RPM-based Linux distributions and Debian. It would be great, if it would support even more platforms, e.g. [[add-a-windows-target-to-the-build-service|Windows]], [[add-osx-target-to-opensuse-build-service|OSX]] or [[add-opensolaris-target-to-opensuse-build-service|OpenSolaris]].</p>
        <p>The downside of having many different platforms in the Build Service is that every platform needs a different way to specify how packages are built. This makes maintaining packages for multiple platforms more difficult than desired as it means maintaining the same information in different ways.</p>
        <p>The solution to that problem could be to have a common way to describe how packages are built, which eliminates the need to maintain the same data in different formats. One approach could be to have a generic description (e.g. in XML) from which the more specific formats are generated.</p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Cornelius Schumacher originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
        <h2>Related Materials</h2>
        <p>There was a Summer of Code project for openSUSE last year which tried to address this problem.</p>
        <p>Maybe we could also reuse concepts or code from Build Buddy.</p>
