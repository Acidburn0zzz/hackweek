        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Some data is stored as a (often relatively large) number of small files within a certain filesystem subtree. Examples are icons or .desktop files. The amount of files and subdirectories makes reading the information or even just looking up a file costly because of necessary disk seeks, especially given that usually a file does not have a set location within the subtree.</p>
        <p>Since these files rarely change, one way to avoid the seeks is to use a cache file for (all or relevant) information from the files. The problem however is checking that the cache is up to date - that would require checking the whole subtree and be therefore as costly. And there is no explicit notification about changes - e.g. .desktop files are installed simply by being put in a suitable location and that's it. Adding explicit notification is not possible e.g. because of backwards compatibility reasons.</p>
        <p>The idea is to add necessary kernel support for propagating information about changes up in directory hierarchy and userspace support for detecting such changes and handling the cache.</p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Lubos Lunak originated this idea, and is currently working on implementing it with Jan Kara.</p>
