        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h5>Problem: Dealing with my digital photos takes TOO LONG!</h5>
        <h5>Solution:</h5>
        <p>  - Take some pictures
          - Plug my camera in to my computer (yes, I'd still get a popup dialog asking me whether I want to import photos)
          - Photos are transferred from my camera to my computer
          - Review photos in full screen
            * During the review the app should let me
              * Delete obvious bad ones (blurry, etc.)
              * Rate the photos
              * Tag the photo (keywords, who's in the photo, etc.)
              * Rotate, adjust the exposure/white balance, fix red-eye, etc.
              * Place them in any of my pre-defined albums (or let me create a new album on the fly)
          - I'm DONE!
            * THIS step is where all the magic happens!
            * Some program (process) should be watching my every move in my photo tool and ...
            * When it detects that I've finished importing my photos (or really any time I modify the tags or organize my photos differently) it takes care of the most important thing...uploading/updating them to Flickr!
              * Converts RAW files to appropriately-sized JPEG files for upload (and then delete the JPEG files off my computer after the upload is finished)
              * Sets the permission on the photo automatically (public/private/family/friends)
                * This could be done based on the tags i add on the photo (with a smart default if the tag isn't there)
              * Adds the photo to a set (match it up with the album I already set up in my photo tool)
                * Match it up with the album I placed the photo in or a special tag/keyword (e.g., "Set:My Best Shots")
            * Extra Credit: New photos are automatically archived onto an external hard drive/server/etc.</p>
        <p>Get the idea?  Get rid of manually exporting/uploading to Flickr!</p>
        <h2>Technologies to Explore/Use</h2>
        <p>  * F-Spot
          * Conduit
          * Others?  Please suggest!</p>
