        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Todays graphic cards have soo much power, why not make use of it for faster video en/decoding?
        Esp. nvidia cards offer the CUDA interface for programming graphic cards like a co-processor.
        The same thing would be possible for CELL processor SPUs.</p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Patrick Kirsch originated this idea.  He is currently working on implementing this idea, but for aircrack and not as mentioned on ffmpeg. This is mostly due to the complexity of the ffmpeg-MPEG implementation. For the sake of simplicity aircrack is choosen, it is for the moment easier to port this project to make use of CUDA and become experienced with this interface. </p>
        <h2>Related Materials</h2>
        <h2>Status</h2>
        <p>As result of the hack week, we have a running aircrack which makes use of the GPU. The exported function includes the Korek attacks, which are now calculated on the graphic card. The next step is now to export the key verification, which is a promising candidate, due to several for loops. Afterwards the two most calculating-intensive functions are transfered to GPU and a final performance analysis can be done. Perhaps this code will find the way to the mainline aircrack trunk.</p>
