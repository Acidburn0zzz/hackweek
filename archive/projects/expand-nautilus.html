        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Nautilus, being elegant and fast, still lacks some vital functions.</p>
        <p>1. browse zip/tar/whatever archives like common folders. Without need of manually unzipping them. Like Konqueror or Explorer in Windows</p>
        <p>2. mount iso's automatically. Just like USB flash drives or CDs, iso-s should be easy to mount with one click. Just one click - and a corresponding icon should appear on the desktop - like a virtual CD. Linux itself already has means of mount isos as loop files - make it more user-friendly!</p>
        <p>3. edit metadata to photos and tags to audio/video files. The point here, is that not only Nautilus should be able to display tags/metadata and sort by it, but it should also allow users to edit tags easily.</p>
        <p>4. append tags to files. Just any - folders, archives, documents, etc. A tag that would allow me to sort my files in a more convenient way.</p>
        <p>5. plugin-system. A more convenient way of extending Nautilus functionality. Just like nautilus-actions - a project now abandoned. That way, users could easily write various extensions to Nautilus. For example, for uploading files to Flickr.</p>
        <p>6. change privileges within Nautilus. It's not convenient, that every time user needs root's privileges for file operations in Nautilus, he should either switch to root or start another copy of nautilus with sudo. Changing privileges (with password promting, naturally) should be available from within nautilus.</p>

        <p>Ilya Ilembitov originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
