        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Many use F-spot to manage their photo library. Yet it's a very self-contained world. </p>
        <p>  * It would be nice if I could import images into the library using other tools. Similarly export.
          * I should be able to have Insert>Photo function in many applications that would allow me to search for photos using tags and provide a small thumbnail roll.
          * Media center application should have access to the photos.
          * The library should be optionally exposed on LAN using bonjour or whatever it's called now.
          * I should be able to transfer photos from my phone over Bluetooth/Obex.</p>
        <p>Maybe there will be enough interest to standardize across management apps such as F-spot and Digikam so that apps would only worry about one API to query for photos.</p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Jakub Steiner originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
