<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>Although there are many high quality "backup" or mirroring utilities (e.g. rsync), many users would welcome a tool for data synchronization - i.e. propagate differences from two sides being synchronized and make both sides to look the same (therefore two-way). Luckily, there is one: unison (see <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/">unison homepage</a>). However, even if unison works very well, it has some disadvantages compared to the tool proposed in this idea. One of them is that the described tool should synchronize not only files with peer PC (through network), but also data from KDE PIM applications as well as from mobile devices connected to the PC.</p>
<h2>What the proposed synchronizer should be capable of:</h2>
<ul>
<li>KDE application (to work with KDE PIM apps)</li>
<li>started automatically with KDE and docked in systray to be able to inform users about its work and to interact with users</li>
<li>specify when and how often synchronize changes</li>
<li>immediately</li>
<li>once per x minutes</li>
<li>on user demand</li>
<li>never</li>
<li>each choice can be assigned to individual network or connection medium (e.g. when connected through modem, synchronize only on user demand)</li>
<li>file synchronization with peer PC through network (exactly like unison):</li>
<li>configure what file/directory masks to ignore or allow</li>
<li>PIM synchronization with peer PC through network (cannot be simply done by unison)</li>
<li>configure which PIM applications (record types) to synchronize or ignore</li>
<li>able to synchronize data with mobile devices as well (mobile/celluar phones, pocket PCs, etc., based on modules in opensync)</li>
<li>notify user about conflicts and let user to solve them</li>
<li>preferably SSH encrypted communication when synchronizing through network (however, can be passed through tunnel)</li>
<li>configurable niceness</li>
</ul>
<h2>What technologies could be used:</h2>
<ul>
<li>KitchenSync (for KDE 4) with opensync as synchronization framework (modules for KDE PIM applications already exist in opensync), new opensync modules will probably be, however, required</li>
<li>inotify for the monitoring of files changed (like beagle)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Possible problems:</h2>
<ul>
<li>locking of files during transfer - content of synchronized files cannot be changed from other tools (even non KDE)</li>
<li>delayed synchronization of files currently being created or changed (edited)</li>
<li>conflicts when a file on both sides is changed at the same time (however, should not be very often ...)</li>
</ul>
<h2>People</h2>
<p>Daniel Tihelka originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
