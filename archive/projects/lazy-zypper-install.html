<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When trying to start a program from the command line that is not yet installed but available in the repositories one gets this helpful message: </p>
<p>"Program X is available in the following packages [...]. To install, try: sudo zypper install X". </p>
<p>If the specified program exists in multiple packages, a list is presented here. </p>
<p>Now a simple but time-saving improvement would be to allow a fast and easy selection of the program you want to have installed. For instance, starting at the first position (which is most likely already the app you want), you could go through the entries of the list using Ctrl-Up / Ctrl-Down. As soon as you release Ctrl the entry you highlighted last is instantly copied into your shell. Then, with a single stroke of Enter you could start the install. </p>
<p>While I would be willig to implement this, I have little idea where to start. From what i heard, the message quoted above is not present in all distributions, so I could imagine it to be suse-specific hack or add-in of the bash, but that's only guessing. If anyone knows more here, a comment would be appreciated. </p>
<p>All hints, doubts and questions are welcome. Feel free to share your thoughts. </p>
<h2>People</h2>
<p>Joschka Fischer originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
