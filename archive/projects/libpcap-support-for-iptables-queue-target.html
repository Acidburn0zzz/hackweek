        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>libpcap should be extended to receive packets comming from iptables NF_QUEUE target. Then
        during firewall configuration you could watch live in wireshark or tcpdump what packets get
        blocked. I think that would be a cool feature.</p>
        <p>pcap already has a syntax for such targets: they could be a magic interface.</p>
        <p>The easiest way to do this would be to use 
        http://www.netfilter.org/projects/libnetfilter_log/index.html
        or 
        http://www.netfilter.org/projects/libnetfilter_queue/index.html
        which are ready libraries for access of the netlink based kernel
        interface for these queue targets.</p>
        <p>These libraries are currently not packaged. An alternative
        would be to write a direct interface to the kernel netlink
        protocol used by the QUEUE target.</p>
        <p>A subtle point is that if the libraries are just used by libpcap would always
        depend on it which I wouldn't like (already too many strict dependencies
        in the distributions). It would be better to use 
        dlopen/dlsym to only load them on demand.</p>
        <p>Bonus points if SuSEfirewall is also changed to insert suitable queue targets
        for each packet drop rule.</p>
        <p>Another bonus point if you add a button to the yast2 firewall configuration
        that starts wireshark for the current configuration for testing
        (and installs it as needed, don't put a depedency in) </p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Andi Kleen originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).
          - Boyang is working on the idea.</p>
