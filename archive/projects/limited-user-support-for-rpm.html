        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>At present the only persons who can make use of the package management on a system are those with administrative privileges. If a user wants to install and run an application as themself they will lose the benefits of package management such as dependency checking & easy installation and removal. </p>
        <p>Windows provides the facility to install MSIs either systemwide requiring administrative privileges or as the user installing.</p>
        <p>RPM provides facility to use an alternative RPM database (a user's own) or simply extract the packages in a different location. Neither of these methods work very well.</p>
        <p>It would be nice if a user could install software & any dependencies as themself in their /home using the system package management. The package manager could then inform the administrator upgrading system software when it is likely to break individual user's own installations as well.</p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Benjamin Weber originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
