        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>BibTex is the bibliography database most used by computer science scholars, coming from the TeX/LaTeX world. I, like lots of academics, have a very large bibtex database of citations, and I don't want to give it up.</p>
        <p>OpenOffice is much more attractive than TeX/LaTeX for writing many technical papers; GUI/WYSIWYG is just more pleasant much of the time. However, OO does **not** work with bibtex :-(</p>
        <p>Idea: provide either an OO module of some kind, or an outboard filter script, to compute a document bibliography using a bibtex database.</p>
        <p>Background: Between TeX and OpenOffice, I spent a bunch of time using FrameMaker to write papers. Frame was (mostly) only for Windows, but I used VMware to host it. I wanted bibtex, and it turns out that there **is** an outboard filter for [[http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~kjt/software/framemaker/fbib.html|BibTeX for FrameMaker]] An easy way to implement this idea would be to adapt fbib so that it can parse OpenDoc instead of Frame's MIL format.</p>
        <p>There is also an "alpha" bibtex for OO project, but work stopped in 2003 [[http://www.math.umd.edu/~dcarrera/openoffice/misc/bibtex/filter.html|OpenOffice BibTeX Filter]] I guess the student graduated :-(</p>
        <p>Reviewing the various projects, it seems this idea has been started several times, and never finished.</p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Crispin Cowan originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
