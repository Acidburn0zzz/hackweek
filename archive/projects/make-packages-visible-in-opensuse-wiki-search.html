        <p><b>Tags:</b> Idea, opensuse</p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I performed a usabilitiy experiment with a certain number of suse employees.
        The task was: "Please check if package <xyz> is available on opensuse"</p>
        <p>With the package being a familiar one to the individual tester.
        All testers started at http://opensuse.org, used the 'search' box and failed.
        Then they went through the menues and finally pulled out their hair in frustration
        while reading docu about the build-service details, without finding a way to the mirrors.
        If encouraged to continue, testers often hit the ISO download site, and eventually
        start to browse raw ftp-directory listings until they reach the desired target.</p>
        <p>I do *not* suggest that this experiment be conducted outside of SUSE. It may bring the concept of frustration in connection with opensuse. Anyway, it was fun to see how so many intelligent people were so easily fooled by the limitations of the existing search engine.</p>
        <p>I rather suggest to enhance the search engine. 
        The opensuse redirector database contains all the needed data. <a href="http://benjiweber.co.uk:8080/webpin/">Benji Weber</a> also finds some of our packages and could be integrated in our wiki search.</p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Juergen Weigert originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
