<h2>Description</h2>
<h5>Project 1: Mobile Device with GPS for improved Training Diagnostics</h5>
<p>There is a huge amount of devices that collect data while training.
Many sportsmen own a heart rate monitor and a speedometer that also records cadence, altitude. Additionally GPS devices aren't expensive anymore. Even the the latest mobile phones have GPS receivers included. The training data could be combined with the geographic data provided by the GPS logger.</p>
<ul>
<li>Record route with the mobile device GPS logger</li>
<li>Record heart rate, speed, power, altitude, cadence and so on</li>
<li>Combine the above mentioned data</li>
<li>Analyze the combined data (e.g. show a map of the area with the highest speed, or select a point of the route and show the corresponding heart rate)</li>
<li>Visualize your daily training data in a diary like Logbook</li>
<li>Show track with mapdata from openstreetmap.org</li>
</ul>
<h5>Project 2: Maps for Mobile Devices with GPS</h5>
<p>To create maps or atlases for offline usage in your mobile GPS device there are currently only some ugly (e.g. googleak) windows tools. </p>
<ul>
<li>Create Maps with different zoomlevels using the maptiles from openstreetmaps or google maps</li>
<li>Plan route with the ActivityDiary (Project1)</li>
<li>Copy routing information and maps to the mobile device</li>
<li>Use the maps in your mobile device as navigation system</li>
</ul>
<h2>People</h2>
<p>Tom Patzig and Thomas Goettlicher originated and worked on this idea.
Please feel free to join.</p>
<p>----</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>After a hard, but very successfull HWÂ³, we accomplished a lot of things on our todo list for the first version of our **openSUSE-ActivityDiary**.</p>
<p>A good Application needs a fantastic Logo...</p>
<p>Robert Lihm was so kind to make us a first draft of the **openSUSE-ActivityDiary** Logo. Lovely.</p>
<p>{{ideas:activitydiary-logo.png|}}</p>
<p>__Successfull fullfilled Tasks:__             </p>
<ul>
<li>a Map View which displays an "infinite" map with maptiles from openStreetMap.org smoothless scrollable and in every zoomlevel</li>
<li>the Map View works in calculated latitude/longitude coordinates to have an exact representation of each point on the map</li>
<li>a transparent downloader with 5 simultaneous download processes, that uses different hosts from openstreetmap.org to download, cache and handout local stored maptiles to the view</li>
<li>a GPX parser to get every property from the recorded GPS file</li>
<li>a diagram-view to show the Altitude-course of your recorded Track</li>
</ul>
<p>__Current features, available with **openSUSE-ActivityDiary**:__</p>
<ul>
<li>smoothless scroll and zoom around the world with the MapView ;-)</li>
<li>offline usage (with cached maptiles from a pre-downloaded area)</li>
<li>import of GPX files</li>
<li>colored Track read from the GPS file</li>
<li>marked Start and End points from the recorded Track</li>
<li>diagram of the Altitude-course from the recorded Track</li>
<li>Additional Track Info (total length, speed, total time)</li>
<li>Start- and End Point of the track can be moved to any waypoint on the track to get the additional info only for that part of the track (speed,time,length,altitude)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are still some things to do, for an release of version 0.1 and we have also great ideas to extend **openSUSE-ActivityDiary** :</p>
<ul>
<li>export new track as gpx file to use in your GPS-Device</li>
<li>combine GPS Data with Data from heart rate device</li>
<li>export and upload Tracks to a public Blog services</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
