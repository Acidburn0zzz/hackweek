<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Increasingly, computational problems are solved using massively parallel networks of computing nodes.  Efficiently using these types of resources requires algorithm and software design that can perform computation in a massively parallel way.  Map-reduce style programming -- where a problem is broken into subproblems, those are //mapped// to computing resources, and then the resulting outputs are //reduced// to a single usable output value is becoming increasingly common.  This type of system has been widely applied to problems like web search and protein folding, but it has many other applications in industry like financial market simulation, intrusion detection, game theoretic strategic modeling, etc.</p>
<p>Google have produced a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce|software package]] to exploit such resource sets for certain kinds of problems, and the [[http://lucene.apache.org/hadoop/about.html">Hadoop</a> project from Apache/Lucene provides an open source framework for MapReduce problem solving.</p>
<p>The proposal is that we build a Map-Reduce appliance for solving these kinds of problems.</p>
<h2>People</h2>
<p>Nat Friedman originated this idea. </p>
<p>John Jolly decided the idea was worth spending his hack-week time.</p>
