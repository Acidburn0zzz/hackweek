        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>One may want to tweak some often used web applications and admins don't want to think about the idea. Typical situation in Novell is tweaking Bugzilla. So there is a question how to modify the page localy. This project is about the answer to this question :-) With this solution you can do even more as you are not limited by other people's needs - only you see the modification. However, my scripts are generaly usable for everyone. They fix annoyance aready reported in Bugzilla but "solved" as RESOLVED WONTFIX by admins.</p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Milan Vancura originated this idea and already done a webpage as a simple script repository (if you don't want  to use userscripts.org forsome internal things) and two scripts:</p>
        <p>  * first one checks you are still logged in even for bugzilla pages where authentication isn't needed, but is important (i.e. search results).
          * second one converts date&time shown at bug page to your local timezone</p>
        <p>Feel free to test them. I'm interested in your feedback.</p>
