        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If a ring can do it, why not our computers? </p>
        <p>User's mood should be a piece of information that applications could then use to alter their behavior (volume control, music playlist suggestions, desktop wallpaper, color theme, screen brightness, IM status, ...). It would be kind of entertaining if an applet could allow me to input the mood I am in.</p>
        <p>Ideally, we would rely on a device to measure the emotional and physical states of our users' and act accordingly. Some research has been done in this area and this could be the next step in wearable computing, a Bluetooth 2.0 body monitor that ease your use of a computer.</p>
        <p>For now, we can probably start working on the software by having the user telling us the mood he/she feels in (very subjective of course).</p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Guy Lunardi originated this idea. In order for this idea to go anywhere, someone will need to take the lead on it please. It's up for grab! Much help requested for this idea.</p>
