        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>GRUB already has networking support, but only for downloading the kernel and
        initrd image. It also has support for serial consoles to choose the kernel and
        to fix your configuration (by using the shell or the interactive editing).</p>
        <p>I'd like to see some network console, i.e. the same interface that I see over
        serial console over network (maybe a simple telnet implementation).</p>
        <p>My personal use case is a home server, where I have no serial console because
        I don't want to put my flat full of cables, and also no screen or keyboard.
        After the power was lost and I had to boot the system, I went into a
        bootloader configuration that doesn't boot. Having a GRUB network console
        would have saved me from about 30 minutes work. :-)</p>
        <p>I know that real data centers don't need something as there's a serial console
        or a management processor anyway.</p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Bernhard Walle originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
