        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>We already have many frameworks to dynamically configure system setting, like NetworkManager for network, kpowersave/gpm/powersave/cpufreq etc. for dynamic powermanagement, SCPM for overall profile switching,
        alsa and various mixer tools for sound volume configuration, etc. ...</p>
        <p>What i'd like to have is a common framework (openHM.org) with a defined API making it easy to integrate it with (UI and automated) frontends and backends/providers to configure certain hardware.
        Think of it as generalized NetworkManger, not only careing about network, but about just anything a appropriate openHM-provider is available.
        Every configuration- and info-provider and every frontend can register and query for certain capabilities and services.</p>
        <p>Of course openHM should also make use of already existing standards in this regard e.g. like d-bus for communication.</p>
        <p>openHM and HAL: Shall this be something similar? No, not at all. HAL could be integrated as a (one of many possible) providers to gather hardware information and trigger certain hardware actions. But of course it would also be possible to integrate backends directly using the kernel.</p>
        <p>This could e.g. lead to general purpose UI-Tools to manage all sorts hardware settings. One could also think of a special backend providing the capability to make changes permanent in a system- and/or in a user-wide way.</p>
        <p>Further it could help to make it easier write certain hardware daemons helping to avoid many possible flaws (like intensive hardware polling when its not needed at all). </p>
