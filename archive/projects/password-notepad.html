<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I use a different password for each site that I connect to, the idea being that I do not want a compromised password in one site to give access to someone to data that I might have in another site.</p>
<p>I keep this in a file ~/docs/passwords.pgp and I use a small shell script file that decodes the passwords to let me see them or edit them, and when I save those changes it encrypts the file again (to prevent accidentally spilling all my passwords).</p>
<p>In Gnome there are things like the Gnome Key Chain that work with desktop applications, but these passwords are for gnome applications, there is no easy-to-use interface for storing other kinds of info (like my social security number, my university id, my MSDN subscription login) </p>
<p>Although Mozilla can remember many of those sometimes I need a bit more data than just the login and passwords or I might want to keep track of various user names, or I might not trust Mozilla enough to keep my passwords (as it often does).</p>
<p>The tool would:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide access to an encrypted file on the disk</li>
<li>Mono has all the crypto libraries needed for this</li>
<li>protect it with a password.</li>
<li>Allow me to search, add, remove entries from this table</li>
</ul>
<p>This could be accomplished by providing a GUI for storing the web site information and storing the data on Gnome KeyRing</p>
<p>Other pluses would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Store the file remotely on a public server</li>
<li>Public server being amazon storage</li>
<li>public server being Google gmail account</li>
<li>Public server being a GData accessible location. </li>
</ul>
<h2>People</h2>
<p>Miguel de Icaza originated this idea. </p>
<h2>Related Materials</h2>
<p>If this is implemented with Mono you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Gnome-KeyRing-Sharp API to store the data </li>
<li>Use GData from Google to store the data in remote sites.</li>
</ul>
