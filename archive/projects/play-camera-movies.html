<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Regular digital cameras today can all record movies. While downloading
of those movies works nicely, the playing of them mostly does not work.</p>
<p>The movies are usually in MOV and AVI containerformats, with usually PCM
audio and Motion JPEG video.</p>
<p>Xine, one of the two major engines and used by the KDE desktop supports playing motion jpeg
videostreams only using "ffmpeg", which we cannot ship on openSUSE.</p>
<p>However, Motion JPEG is not patent encumbered as other codecs in the ffmpeg pack.</p>
<p>The project gets movies playing with the openSUSE out-of-the-box
OSS libraries and the code will be integrated into xine.</p>
<p>http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1744426&group_id=9655&atid=359655 is my patch submission to Xine SF.</p>
<p>(Originally I also wanted to tackle gstreamer, but it already has Motion JPEG support seperately.
 It can play AVIs in 10.2 out of the box, but no MOV files. The latter is already fixed for 10.3).</p>
