<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Banshee is a music playback and management application built on the Mono runtime. Capitalizing on Banshee's platform-independent design, this idea is to port the program to the Windows desktop. </p>
<p>In addition to providing our Windows brethren with the best open source music player ever, this project will forward the effort to test Mono/Windows compatibility in an important direction: bringing a Linux application to Windows.</p>
<p>Major work will include porting hardware support, CD-Burning, and media playback to Windows. At the conclusion of this port, Banshee should support Windows as a stable build target for many releases to come. (information from Banshee's project site).</p>
<p>Several vendors have expressed interested in using Banshee if it was available on Windows as well.</p>
<p>This idea has been well documented through over initiatives but could greatly benefit from the Hack Week specifically.</p>
<h2>People</h2>
<p>Aaron Bockover originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
