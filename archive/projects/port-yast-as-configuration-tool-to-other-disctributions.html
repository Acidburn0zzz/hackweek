        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The idea is to make YaST portable to any other distributions. I did something similar in past : 
        http://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=YaST%3ASVN but there was problem that I was able to build it only to rpm-based distributions (it was Fedora in that case). With this initiative :
        http://idea.opensuse.org/content/ideas/making-the-yast2-ui-usable-without-all-the-ycp-stuff
        UI will be independent from zypp so it is only pkg-bindings which are depended on rpm. For other distributions we can create pkg-bindings-fake and their developers can write necessarily code for that later.</p>
        <p>Also we should provide mechanism to build SCR agents (System Configuration Repository - http://forgeftp.novell.com/yast/doc/SLES9/tdg/html/id_big_architecture.html#id2529648) from other locations depended on distribution. They needs other agents, because there are other configuration location or configuration is merged/splitted into different count of files. It's similar like NetworkManager uses different configurations for different distributions but there is one shared place for upstream sources.</p>
        <p>Just to keep in mind Yet Another Link - some development problems but not realted to porting (except last one): http://en.opensuse.org/YaST_Problems_from_Developer's_View</p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Michal Zugec originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
