        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>At the moment the situation with audio controls in GNOME is disastrous. Open Application Browser. Under "Multimedia" category you''l see 9 (!) different apps that allow user to either set volumes, manage PulseAudio or see volume level (just indicators, for capture or output). Control Center offers another tool to deal with sound configuring routines, YaST - Yet another Sound Tool. So, at least 11 (!) tools to configure sound - and no universal among them.</p>
        <p>So, there's a great need for several things:</p>
        <p>1. make a strict distinction between which sound issues should be solved from within YaST, and which - from within Control Center.</p>
        <p>2. provide centralized ways of setting volume for all channels and configuring PulseAudio.</p>
        <p>3. make those tools present the channels on user's audio card in a convenient and organized form. Some of the present tools would show something like a dozen of different channel on my laptop (Dell Inspiron 1525), whereas in fact I have only a simple 2-channel integrated speakers, a simple 2-channel integrated mic, two headphone outs, one external mic in. So the tool by default hides the channels that are actually active, and when I try to define, what channels I want to be able to manage, it shows like 4 different mics, different speakers (I don't have 5.1 system here!) and so on. That's really bad, since I can't make my mic work without trying all those channels.</p>

        <p>Ilya Ilembitov originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
