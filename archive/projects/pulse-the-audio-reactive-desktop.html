        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>  * Compiz should react to sounds.  
          * There should be a plugin for Banshee that can pass some sort of audio signals (levels, hertz, etc.) to Compiz.  Background windows could dance when music is playing; the wallpaper / desktop background could dim a bit and disco-ball light effects could spin around a little.  
          * Sound events could cause windows to pulse a little.
          * Perhaps Compiz itself could (optionally) generate sounds, something like a rubber band or "boiiiiing!" when windows stretch.  Minimization (and restoring) would be interesting.
          * Obviously, we'd want a way to pipe a microphone input to this as well.  Wouldn't it be fun at a rock concert, or if someone in the next cubicle sneezes?</p>
