        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>**A "Recovery" mode for RAID5 where I/O errors don't cause disk failures.**</p>
        <p>When a RAID5 set is in degraded mode and suffers an additional disk failure, the set is taken completely offline making any data recovery impossible. Software RAID is being used increasingly in environments where hot spares aren't readily available and there may be delays in disk replacement.</p>
        <p>Example:
        With a 3 disk RAID5 set in degraded mode, a single bad sector on one of the remaining constituent disks will cause the array to go completely offline, causing any additional accesses to fail with I/O errors. In this case, the array may still be up solely to be used to recover any existing data and will ultimately be destroyed. Denying access to all the data is clearly suboptimal.</p>
        <p>If the array is in degraded mode and suffers a disk failure, there will already be data loss due to the corrupted read/write. Perhaps a better solution would be to deny future writes and leave the array online for data recovery. The on-disk metadata could be updated to indicate that the disk has failed so that future array assemblies must be completed manually.</p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Jeff Mahoney originated this idea.
        Neil Brown may be interested in this idea.
        No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
