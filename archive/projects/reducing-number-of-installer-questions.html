        <h1>Reducing number of Installer Questions</h1>
      </div>

        <p><b>Tags:</b> Idea, Installation</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Explore how few questions can you ask a user and be able to gather all necessary data for a simple default install and determine what other sources of information you will need to have available to automatically infer other information </p>
<p>For instance, are the following 4 questions enough:</p>
<p>a) User name
b) Password
c) Location (deriving timezone, language, keyboard layout from this
info, ntp for time, use hardware autodetect for the rest)
d) optionally a "I prefer to work in english" check box for US keyboard
and english even though location wouldn't dictate that.</p>
<p>Of course you have to ask this in the language of the user, so you may need to add that as well, or maybe you rely on the user picking the language when they pick their live CD installer.  </p>
<p>Focus on a general not a special case, ie assume we can just install NetworkManager for them, the Sax detection automatically works, sound is configured etc, which is generally is and eliminate those work flow screens.  People should still be able to access the expert screens but they should not see them by default.</p>
<h2>People</h2>
<p>JP Rosevear originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
