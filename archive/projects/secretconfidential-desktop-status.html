        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There should be a secret/confidential/private mode selection for Desktop. Once the user selects this mode, there should be no log for (most of) the operations that he do.</p>
        <p>For instance: </p>
        <p>The browser should not remember the pages that are visited. No history / passwords/ form-data should be recorded during this session. </p>
        <p>Evolution should not try to copy sent-items. </p>
        <p>Nautilus should not remember recently visited directories or files. If needed, we can choose not to update even the file last-accessed time as well.</p>
        <p>All IM and IRC Conversations that happen during this time should go without a log. </p>
        <p>This could come in handy in scenarios when a computer is shared by many people but the users dont have the rights to create new users for them. For instance, computers at net-centres, etc.</p>
        <p>Also, it is a lot helpful when you are conversing with your ex-GirlFriend and you don't want your wife to find it out.</p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Sankar P originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
