<h2>Description</h2>
<p>On usual suspend to disk all other userspace processes are frozen and the whole (used/allocated) memory is put to disk.
What i'd like to have is something similar, but with just of a finer granularity, being able to suspend-to-disk single processes or groups of processes.</p>
<p>The usecases i have in mind reach from making boot faster (just resuming the services processes instead of starting them from scratch - wherer possible/appropriate), over easy restoring of previous desktop sessions of apps (if they e.g. have no possibility to fully save their current state) .. to process migration between (also perhaps virtualized) machines.</p>
<p>For the desktop / on notebooks we already have that possibility wiht usual suspend-to-disk (coming back exactly where i left), but often i'd like to have that feature just for some specific applications.</p>
<p>I'm not fully sure if something similar perhaps already exists. Please tell me if you know more about this.</p>
<h2>People</h2>
<p>Frank Seidel originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
