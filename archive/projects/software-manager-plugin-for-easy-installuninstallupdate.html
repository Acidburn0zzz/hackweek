        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>To put this very simple: the OpenSuSE version of the CNR plugin, but working with the OpenSuSE software portal!</p>
        <p>The idea is to create a CNR-like Plugin where people could simply choose what they want to Install. But specially (since "1 click install" is already available) what they want to Uninstall or Update/Upgrade without having to know anything about libraries, repos, dependencies or anything else.</p>
        <p>Want to uninstall - Just select the program you want to uninstall, click uninstall and it's done!  The plugin would do all the cleanings for you (such as, for example, when i uninstall a software I do not want his repos to be installed anymore - the plugin should erase them).</p>
        <p>Same thing to Update/Upgrade and to Installation.</p>
        <p>It would be good if this was integrated with the software available in the software portal and also get notifications on new updates to software.</p>
        <p>Why? Well, everytime i talk about how good Linux is, everyone seems to like a lot about what they're earing but when i get to the part concerning software Instalation/Uninstalation/Update... well... they all quickly quite the change from Windows to Linux. Software is the window to the world... This has to be made easy to hit the masses - that most don't know much about computers OS.</p>
