        <h1>Statistics about disc accesses from kernel</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is about creating an interface in where the kernel can notify interested user space
        processes about which pages of which files are accessed for what reason from what process.
        Probably hooking somewhere in the block layer, and streaming the info over relayfs.</p>
        <p>Those information can be used to gather access statistics, for instance for a later block
        remapper, or just to find the most used shared libs or other files for whole system profiling.</p>
        <p>The information necessary is at least (inode,offset,length), but it would be good to have
        also the device number (to know where the inode is coming from) and possibly the whole path
        to the file.</p>
        <p>In addition to that it would also be nice to learn about other file system related stuff
        other processes do.  E.g. tracking when processes open/stat/mmap files.  Sort of a strace, but
        for all processes in the system merged into one stream the interested process could capture.</p>
        <p>Something like that could be possible with kprobes, don't know.</p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Michael Matz originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
