        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Currently SaX2 only supports a few TabletPCs by default. These are at the moment:
          * ACER TravelMate C30x series (SERIAL)
          * Fujitsu Lifebook T series (SERIAL)
          * Fujitsu Lifebook P series (SERIAL, touchscreen)
          * Gateway M280E (Finepoint FPI2004) 
          * HP Compaq TC1000 (FPI2002)
          * HP Compaq TC4200 (SERIAL)
          * IBM X41 TABLET PC (SERIAL)
          * Lenovo X61 TABLET PC (SERIAL)
          * Motion M1200 (SERIAL)
          * Motion M1400 (SERIAL)
          * Wacom ISDV4 TABLET PC (SERIAL) (with touch support)
          * Wacom ISDV4 TABLET PC (USB)</p>
        <p>You can e.g. run Wacom based often with the generic "Wacom ISDV4" entries, but they don't work in every case. SaX2 should support more TabletPCs with useful default settings.</p>
        <p>An other problem is that there no good support for the Touch devices of TabletPCs with a Wacom USB Tablet. The source of the problem is that there is no persistent device name (or link) for these devices under /dev/input/.</p>
        <p>__What is to do?__
           - Support Touch devices of Wacom USB TabletPCs:
             * fix udev to generate persistent device links for these devices
             * extend the existing generic 'Wacom ISDV4 TABLET PC (USB)' SaX2 entry with a default config for touch
           - Support more TabletPc which uses only Touchscreen or non-Wacom Tablets:
             * fix SaX2 Touchscreen port handling (allow other /dev/input/ paths)
             * check, install and may update udev rules for existing touchscreen drivers
             * collect existing touchscreen entries for TabletPCs under 'TABLET PCs'
           - Add more TabletPCs to SaX2:
             * get in contact with TabletPC users or search for settings in the internet
             * add new machines to SaX2 (also such which only uses Touchscreens)
             * may extend HAL to detect machines as TabletPCs (if needed)
           - submit the patches for SaX2 and udev upstream
           - may update [[http://en.opensuse.org/TabletPCs|openSUSE TabletPC wiki page]]</p>
        <p>__What can you do?__</p>
        <p>Report currently not supported machines to [[http://en.opensuse.org/User:Dkukawka|Danny Kukawka]] with everything you needed to change in you xorg.conf. If you needed to calibrate your tablet (e.g. via wacomcpl), send also the calibration data/information. Also the output of lshal would help.</p>
        <p>__Status:__
           * patched udev to add persistent by-id links (submitted upstream)
           * install udev rules of evtouch, added one more machine to the rules
           * extended SaX2 cdb with new machines and updated generic entry (get upstream as soon udev patch is integrated upstream)
           * move touchscreen based TabletPCs to a common 'TABLET PCs' entry of the SaX2 'Touchscreen' section
           * fixed SaX2 to handle ports/device path of touchscreen devices correctly (see this [[http://dkukawka.blogspot.com/2008/08/tabletpcs-new-machines-and-fixes-for.html|post]])
           * updated udev and SaX2 packages available in [[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/dkukawka/|openSUSE Build Service]]
           * now SaX2 supports also these machines:
            * Clevo TN120R (a.k.a Nexoc Osiris S621) 
            * Gateway C-120X and E-155C (USB)
            * Gateway C-140X and E-295C (Serial)
            * Gateway C210X (Serial fpit)
            * HP Compaq 2710p/2730p
            * HP Pavilion tx2000 series (USB)
            * HP Pavilion tx2100 series (USB)
            * HP Pavilion tx2500 series (USB)
            * HP TC4400 (Serial)
            * LG LT20 Tablet PC (Serial)
            * LG C1 (Serial, fujitouch)
            * Panasonic Toughbook CF-18 (Serial)
            * Samsung Q1-Ultra (evtouch)
            * Toshiba Portégé M series Tablet PC (Serial)
            * Toshiba Satellite R15/R20 (Serial)
            * Toshiba Tecra M series Tablet PC (Serial)</p>
