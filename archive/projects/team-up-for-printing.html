<h2>Description</h2>
<p>"Printing does not work" Hubert once said. </p>
<p>While many parts of our printing pipeline are quite solid nowadays (cups, kprinter, gimpprint), the interface between the individual components could be improved. I consider both generation of postscript pages and the processing of postscript pages as part of one printing pipeline. Currently applications focus on generating, 
and cups focusses on processing, with very limited interaction between these two parts.</p>
<p>The printer-dialog that a user sees should not be application specific, it should be considered part of the operating system, with application specific plugins on one end and cups specific plugins on the other. </p>
<p>I suggest to implement a generic preview mechanism, that brings back an image of a printed page to the user from as late in cups as possible. I'd expect to see the effects of settings like multi-page printing, scaling, rotation in such a preview.</p>
<p>I also suggest to integrate all the available psutils into this printing pipeline as plugins.
e.g. the commandline tools pstops and poster are most useful, but badly need an interactive GUI.</p>
<p>Application specific plugins could e.g. define font sizes to a browser and cause HTML-page layouts to depend on such settings.</p>
<h2>People</h2>
<p>Juergen Weigert originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
