        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Consider the scenario:</p>
        <p>Nat gives a demo of SLED 11 and its cool features. This is recorded and the video is uploaded in a web-server. Now Novell employees can either </p>
        <p>1) Download the video and watch it offline (or)</p>
        <p>2) Stream through their browser (.FLV etc)</p>
        <p>As per our plan, the server will split the video file into manageable chunks and sends the chunks to the clients requested.</p>
        <p>It is highly improbable that all employees will start watching the video at the same instant. Subsequent new user requests to view the file can be redirected to any of the old clients who have already downloaded the chunks. The server should track which users have which chunks and should be able to redirect any further user requests.</p>
        <p>The server should have a decent distribution algorithm so that not a single/group of clients are bombarded with many requests by many clients.</p>
        <p>Optionally, the server may choose to send the 1st chunk alone by itself.</p>
        <p>This idea is very much like bit-torrent and is essentially trying to adapt the bit-torrent for multimedia streaming.</p>
        <p>This should hopefully reduce the server traffic.</p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Sankar P originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
        <h2>Related Materials</h2>
        <p>Thanks to Raja Harinath who pointed me to http://esm.cs.cmu.edu/ </p>
        <p>But instead of relying on a thick client-side application to achieve this, we should try to make a firefox-plugin </p>
        <p>We can make use of a player like VLC player which will not require the full file to play multimedia content.</p>
