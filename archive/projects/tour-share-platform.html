        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lots of people like to go by bike, hike or walk, go by car or even boat. All
        these people have their secret (or not so) favorite trails.</p>
        <p>Quite similar to video share platforms we could set up a tour-share platform.
        Interested people add a short description of their trip and describe the way they
        went, drove or whatever. In addition to that, photos or videos give more ideas of 
        the landscape and details. The author can pick 'well known places' along the tour
        and name them.</p>
        <p>Have not investigated yet, but I can imagine that we could use a free format
        to specify the tour data and along with affordable GPS stuff it should be possible
        to record that data during the trip?!</p>
        <p>The peace that is missing IMO in that idea is a real reason why people should 
        really enter their trip data - that probably can be a lot of work, more than 
        just uploading my latest my-dog-in-the-swimming-pool video. We have to find a 
        way to make the membership of the community something people like to have :-)</p>
        <p>Couldn't that be a cool web20 thing?</p>
