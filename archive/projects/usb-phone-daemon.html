<h2>Description</h2>
<p>USB Phones are slick little devices that generally have a USB audio device and an HID keypad.  On windows they come with little programs that read they key-presses and send them on to Skype.  On Linux at best they show up as a normal keyboard, which is nice in that it's usable but not so nice as you can't just start typing (the VoIP application needs to already have focus).</p>
<p>Ekiga has a dbus interface (Skype on Linux also does) that can be used for this purpose.  Also there is an call that could be used to get an exclusive lock on the phone's keypad so that it's key-presses only go to the phone daemon.</p>
<h2>People</h2>
<p>Andrew Jorgensen originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
