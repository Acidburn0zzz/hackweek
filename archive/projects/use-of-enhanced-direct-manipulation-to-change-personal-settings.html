        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>  * How can we enhance configuration tasks by
            * enhanced direct manipulation
            * use of 3D-elements
            * perhaps adoption of some game interaction techniques?</p>
        <p>  * The idea to use 3D-environments and direct manipulation to enhance the interaction possibilities with the ui is not new (Apple, IBM, Microsoft made their experience with it). The idea behind is, that the presentation and interaction in a kind of "real live environment" will reduce the learning curve drastically and the side-effect will be some "universal usability" (e.g. older users are not forced to learn new interaction techniques).
          * The range of the interaction can reach from "full simulation" (e.G. Erlanger 3D-BÃ¼ro [screenshots will be added], Second Life) to reduced complexity (power plant control by use of Star Craft dialog elements http://www.benjamins.nl/cgi-bin/t_articles.cgi?bookid=IDJ%2010%3A1&artid=938017538) to abstract direct manipulation (Apple Stacks http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/features/desktop.html).
          * The challenge at the other side is, that simulation environments can be unproductive (except in the special context of pc games). </p>
        <p>  * The question is: can we use some of the concepts to provide a cool configuration experience ... perhaps in addition to the current existing one? Look at the "Gnome Desktop Font Preferences" or the "Menu and Toolbar Preferences". Is this a cool experience to change the settings?</p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Siegfried Olschner originated this idea.  He is currently working on creating illustrations for this idea.</p>
        <h2>Related Materials</h2>
        <p> * 14 years ago -- really advanced 3D ui:

        <h2>Some Results</h2>
        <h5>First concept drafts</h5>
        <p>  * The basic idea was to provide a kind of desktop fake. 
          * All elements with changeable properties will be marked via mouse over effects. 
          * A click will open the options box. 
          * Perhaps the user can activate a kind of tooltip help.</p>

        <p>{{ideas:draft0.jpg?400}}</p>
        <h5>Thinking about some details</h5>
        <p>  * How to visualize the screensaver in this concept? Via illustration in the background?
          * Can we find a kind of consistent selection mode where the user can pick one option -- e.g. in the screensaver selection.
            * Perhaps via vertical scroll of elements while the other dialog elements are displayed beside
          * How to cross screensaver selection with the adjustment of hot corners?
          * etc., etc.</p>

        <h5>How to open</h5>
        <p>  * A nice try
            * Not acceptable in the view of accessability
            * Only available during use of XGL?</p>

        <h5>Some mockups</h5>
        <p>  * Some trials to find a good way to visualize interactive sections on the "faked desktop"
          * I think a visual designer can produce better solutions</p>

        <h5>Change of the concept</h5>
        <p>  * The concept above shows a kind of "whow-effect" but owns may challenges in the details</p>
        <p>  * NEW: User can activate the "personal preferences setup" via keyboard or menu selection by mouse
          * Like the Apple Dashboard the personal preferences items will fly in (animation!), the background is darkened
          * Mouse over one element will enlight it, the others are darkened
          * Click will expand the selection to a window. It's size is big enough to provide enough space for very comfortable item selection in direct way
            * E.g. font selection: The fonts are displayed with their shape, the size is adjusted to the current selection
            * Icon set selection: The icon theme is represented via some examples</p>
