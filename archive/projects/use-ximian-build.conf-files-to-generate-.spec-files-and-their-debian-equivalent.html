        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Packaging using .spec is a pain.  The format is redundant, hard to parse with external tools, and generally makes me sad.  Using Ximian Build Buddy was in many ways more pleasant: it abstracted away most of the really ugly parts of .spec, and was generally much less redundant (aside from the all the xml tags 8-)).</p>
        <p>Fortunately, the various elements of the Ximian build system are loosely coupled; it wouldn't be too difficult to a) just adapt the ximian-build.conf -> whatever.spec conversion, b) continue to use the rest of the suse/osc build system which is in most respects better, and c) keep the ability to still use .spec when it's truly necessary.</p>
        <p>I've long thought of it thus: writing .spec is like writing programs in assembly.  Let's at least start using C.</p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Michael Wolf originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
