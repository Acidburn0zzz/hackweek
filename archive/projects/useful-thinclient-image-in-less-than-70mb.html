        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Many companies are using thin clients to allow a specific task to be done with it.
        The advantage is that a thin client is a complete computer but manufactured as low
        expensive device which means you have only a limited set of hardware resources.
        In order to be able to run SUSE Linux on such a device you need to specify the
        use case first. I would like to use the terminal on my desk as a low noise network
        browsing station. To get that done we need:</p>
        <p>  * X11 graphics system
          * A display manager
          * A window manager
          * An internet browser
          * Hardware support for all pieces of the machine</p>
        <p>The machine I have for testing is sold with a 128MB flash card. The complete system
        should fit into less than 70MB in order to be able to save some data one may have
        downloaded from the network. The system should not require any configuration which
        means you switch it on and it automatically configures all services and sets itself
        into the network. Of course an existing network infrastructure like a DHCP server is
        required in order to do that.</p>
