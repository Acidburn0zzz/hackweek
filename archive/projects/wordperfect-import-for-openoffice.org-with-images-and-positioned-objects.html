<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Current libwpd-based WordPerfect import filter for OpenOffice.org does not import images, text-boxes and other positioned objects. The idea would be to use libwpg that was developed partly as a result of last year's OOo GSoC project and to enhance the current importer to convert the images as well. The step towards this is to port the current converter to output odt files instead of legacy sxw files it does until now. Second step would be to read the relevant information from the WPD files and glue libwpd and libwpg in a way that they can collaborate in converting embedded images. Since this will mean ABI incompatible changes to libwpd, it is to be done first as a command-line converter and to examine the possibility of integrating it to the Novell version of OpenOffice.org later.</p>
<h2>People</h2>
<p>Fridrich Strba originated this idea. He is currently working on implementing this idea. The project is basically on a good way. All technical problems are overcome, what needs to be finalized are some TrainedMonkey style details :-). The code to be found in libwpd's (http://libwpd.sf.net) and libwpg's (http://libwpg.sf.net) CVS. (For the later, in "fs_experimental" branch and for the former, in HEAD). Libwpd along with writerperfect in HEAD are now producing valid ODT documents in flat XML and in zipped format. Libwpd is able to extract the embedded binary objects from WordPerfect files for an ulteriour processing. Writerperfect uses libwpg to convert the embedded WPG images and insert them in the resulting document as an editable Draw object. For alien file-formats (JPEG, PS, EPS), there is now an API in libwpd to pass them to the application as an embedded OLE object. What needs to be done is to get the sizes, the anchoring and the positions of the frames correctly. If granted ITO, I would continue on linking some lose ends. </p>
