        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>When a fsck fails during boot most non technical users right now are in deep ***.
        The system asks lots of obscure question which the user usually doesn't
        know anything about. This can still happen with journaling file systems e.g.
        after an IO error.</p>
        <p>My suggestion would be to write a higher level frontend for e2fsck
        that gets activated during a forced fsck.</p>
        <p>The frontend could be console mode, otherwise an X server would need
        to be started (would need to interact nicely with the splash screen then).
        Or perhaps starting an X server isn't too bad.</p>
        <p>It should first give a clear high level message about what happened
        (e.g. Checking your file system because of I/O error)
        When there is any error that normally requires user to answer a question
        it should suggest to either always answer y or allow the user to answer
        all the question if they're an expert.</p>
        <p>Then afterwards it should give a summary of the files in /lost+found
        (size/ file(1) output etc.)</p>
        <p>There could be probably be more done to improve this.</p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Andi Kleen originated this idea. Bernhard Walle will work on this during
        HackWeek.</p>
