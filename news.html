                      <p>Hack Week 9 is over and we saw a lot of exciting projects. Now the only bit 
                      missing is choosing the winners of the <a href="awards.html">Hack Week awards</a>.</p>

                      <p>Please make sure that your project pages in the <a href="https://github.com/SUSE/hackweek/wiki">Hack Week Wiki</a> are up to date and contain all the information the Hack Week award jury needs by end of this week. We'll use this as the base for choosing the winners.</p>

                    <span class="text">
                      <p>We are on day 2 of Hack Week 9. Lots of interesting projects are going on.
                      Let's make sure that they are not happening in the hidden, but that they are 
                      visible to our colleagues and everybody else who is interested.</p>

                      <p>Make sure your project is on the <a href="https://github.com/suse/hackweek/wiki">Hack Week 9 Wiki</a>.</p>

                      <p>It doesn't matter if it's a big project of a team of developers porting the 
                      distribution to a new platform, or if it's just the one small bug in your 
                      desktop you always wanted to fix. Just make sure that there is a trail of what 
                      you are doing on the Wiki.</p>

                      <p>Another great way to document Hack Week is pictures and movies. There even are 
                      prizes for the best ones as part of the Hack Week awards.</p>

                      <p>Record people in action, take photos of what you built, or portrait people 
                      hacking away on their projects. We have a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/hackweek/">Hack Week Flickr group</a>.</p>

                      <p>Finally blog, tweet, dent, whatever, to let your colleagues, friends, and the 
                      community know what is happening. We use the hashtag #hackweek9.</p>
