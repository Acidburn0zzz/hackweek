Here is a space for projects to store code, if they prefer to not use a separate
repository somewhere else. Create a subdirectory (ideally named as your project
in the Wiki) and put your code there.

Using separate repositories is perfectly fine, though. Just make sure you link
them from the project page in the Wiki.
